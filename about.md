Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Drew. Welcome to my site! A bit about me...

After graduating from Georgia Tech, I spent my immediate post-college years in the world of [investment management](https://www.balentine.com/investments). I learned that markets are incredibly unpredictable, no one *really* knows which direction prices move in the short-term, and handling money for others can be...stressful.

I bid goodbye to my suit and tie in July 2021 (too hot for Atlanta, anyway), and spent the next year immersing myself in the courses offered through the [Masters in Analytics program at Georgia Tech](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu/). The program and this period in my life would come to serve as a bridge from the conventional world of investment management to the tech-driven world that I was about to enter.

In the summer of 2022, I stepped into a new realm at Shopify - an opportunity to port techniques from my investment background along with some newly acquired skills into a new context, logistics. This detour enriched my data toolkit, and allowed me to wear multiple hats, principally that of "full-stack data scientist."

What fufills me and induces flow states: constructing solutions that eliminate friction to make life a bit easier, enabling end-to-end automation, and venturing into the wider universe of coding beyond the familiar territory of Jupyter notebooks.

I work (or at least I think I do!) according to a few key principles: 

* Embrace consistency over sporadic intensity
* Work with your natural rythms. For me, that means harnessing the mental freshness of the early morning to tackle hard problems
* Practice the art of patient learning. Sit comfortably with ambiguity, allow ideas to brew, and wait for the pieces to fall into place.

As for what lies ahead, I'm eager to find a mission that resonates with me, one where I can contribute meaningfully alongside curious minds with a lot to teach. Stay tuned!
